# all setup is working fine....

basically your subsciption does not have the preset vm available. hence why the template fails

if you use a different machine that is a simple one & supported on any region you can later scale up your vm to include dedicated graphics


working great, set up my server on https://jup.for1.in:8000/user/adminn/notebooks/fastai/course-v3/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb

ssh to  the server also works fine. All hady dandy..


done
